# FFXIV-Island-Sanctuary-Pasture-Optimization

The purpose of these notebooks is to optimize what 20 animals to choose for your Pasture in FFXIV's Island Sanctuary content to keep up with Workshop demands. This code was developed with aid from the [Overseas Casuals](https://discord.gg/overseascasuals) Discord server.

This is a personal project and thus is not likely to be optimized for general use.

This code is updated to reflect Patch 6.4 changes.
